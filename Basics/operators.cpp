*	multiplication
/	division
%	modulus
// compound operators
y += x;	is equivalent to y = y + x;
x -= 5;	is equivalent to y x = x - 5;
x /= y;	is equivalent to y x = x / y;
price *= units + 1;	is equivalent to y price = price * (units+1);
etc.
// increment an decrement operators

! is boolean NOT
|| is boolean OR
&& is boolean AND
stops evaluating once answer is found, ex. ((5==5) || (3>6)) upon checking that 5==5 is true it will stop and return true
//ternary operator
condition ? result-if-true : result-if-false
//comma operator
a = (b=3,b+2), output of a = 5 and b = 3
//bitwise operators
&	AND	Bitwise AND
